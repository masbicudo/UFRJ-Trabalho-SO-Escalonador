#   time_slice: number of time units for each time-slice
#   == memory manager ==
#   memory_frames: number of frames available for the processes, represents the amount of installed RAM
#   max_working_set: maximum number of frames that the OS can give to a single process
# [devices]
#   used to connect devices to the OS
# [timeline]
#   global timeline actions
#   time in this section are relative to the OS global time
#   a process created here means that the OS is spawning the process
# [process N]
#   where N is an spid number of a process created in the global timeline
#   times in this section are relative to the running time of the process
#   a process created here means that it is a child process

# Instructions:
# new N - creates a new process with spid N
# end - terminates the process
# pc N - execute instructions at virtual address at page N

[ process 0 ]
  # The first read of a process if triggered by the OS to read the entry point at page 0.
  # The other reads are triggered by the process when it tries to access memory.
  # Each read operation has the number of the page that is to be used.
  # If the page/frame mapping is available inside the page table use it.
  # Otherwise, block the process and load the frame from the secondary storage.
