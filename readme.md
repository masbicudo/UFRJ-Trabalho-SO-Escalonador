# TODO

- txt plan: check that all processes have an end time
- txt plan: allow unordered spid creation
- txt plan: change order of params -- time, spid, instruction, arg
- max_wait_time should come from the simulation plan

# Limitations

- No check after invoking malloc,
    this could cause out of memory bugs.

- All queues support max amount of processes,
    this is not realistic, it should grow depending on the system load.

- Last access time is not really something that can be done in real hardware,
    what is done is to set the access bit to 0 every N time units,
    and check which of them were set to 1 in the mean time.
    We are not doing this in this simulation...
    we just store the current time unit on each access.

## Memory
- Installed RAM is given in terms of frames, not in terms of bytes
- Swap size is not specified, we assumed no limits at all

## Assumptions

- the program starts always at the virtual address 0
- the program has no limit to the amount of virtual memory available
- there will be no writes, except for swap-out operations
- there is no Translation Lookaside Buffer
- each process has it's own page table, i.e. it is not a inverted page table
- page replacement policy is local LRU with a fixed size maximum working set
- swap in/out does not know the address of the frame inside the secondary storage
- there is only one CPU, and only one currently executing frame
- frames executing or being swapped-in/ou are marked as in_use
- each frame/page is 4KB
- the processing unit is a process, there is no threads
